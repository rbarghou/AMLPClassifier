# AMLPClassifier
Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron

## Overview
This project provides a simple class that extends the scikit-learn MLPClassifier class with additional functionality.

The goal of this functionality is to create neural networks which grow as they train, perhaps allowing faster training times.
